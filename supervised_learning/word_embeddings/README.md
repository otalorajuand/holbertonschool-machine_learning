# Natural Language Processing - Word Embeddings

> The project's main objectives are outlined, which include addressing several conceptual questions related to NLP and word embeddings. These questions range from defining what natural language processing is to exploring various word embedding techniques such as bag of words, TF-IDF, CBOW, skip-gram, n-grams, negative sampling, and popular word embedding models like word2vec, GloVe, fastText, and ELMo.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is natural language processing?
* What is a word embedding?
* What is bag of words?
* What is TF-IDF?
* What is CBOW?
* What is a skip-gram?
* What is an n-gram?
* What is negative sampling?
* What is word2vec, GloVe, fastText, ELMo?
