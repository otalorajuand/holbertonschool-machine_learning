# Classification

> In this project we create neural networks from scratch in order to understand the underlying components of that model and how it can be applied to classification of images.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is a model?
* What is supervised learning?
* What is a prediction?
* What is a node?
* What is a weight?
* What is a bias?
* What are activation functions?
** Sigmoid?
** Tanh?
** Relu?
** Softmax?
* What is a layer?
* What is a hidden layer?
* What is Logistic Regression?
* What is a loss function?
* What is a cost function?
* What is forward propagation?
* What is Gradient Descent?
* What is back propagation?
* What is a Computation Graph?
* How to initialize weights/biases
* The importance of vectorization
* How to split up your data
* What is multiclass classification?
* What is a one-hot vector?
* How to encode/decode one-hot vectors
* What is the softmax function and when do you use it?
* What is cross-entropy loss?
* What is pickling in Python?
