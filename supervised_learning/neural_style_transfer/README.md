# Neural Style Transfer

> Neural Style Transfer is an applicaction of image classification models, where you can extract the content and the style from two different images, in order to combine both to generate a third image that have the content of the first and the style of the second.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is Neural Style Transfer?
* What is a gram matrix?
* How to calculate style cost
* How to calculate content cost
* What is Tensorflowâ€˜s Eager Execution?
* What is Gradient Tape and how do you use it?
* How to perform Neural Style Transfer
