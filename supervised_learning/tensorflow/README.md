# Tensorflow

> Tensorflow is a python library to construct neural networks. In this project we apply Tensorflow's method to understand how it works and how it can be applied.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is tensorflow?
* What is a session? graph?
* What are tensors?
* What are variables? constants? placeholders? How do you use them?
* What are operations? How do you use them?
* What are namespaces? How do you use them?
* How to train a neural network in tensorflow
* What is a checkpoint?
* How to save/load a model with tensorflow
* What is the graph collection?
* How to add and get variables from the collection

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:
