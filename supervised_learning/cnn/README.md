# CNN

> Convolutional Neural Networks are the benchmark model for image recognition. In this project we explore how to implement this model from scratch, and using two frameworks: keras and tensorflow.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is a convolutional layer?
* What is a pooling layer?
* Forward propagation over convolutional and pooling layers
* Back propagation over convolutional and pooling layers
* How to build a CNN using Tensorflow and Keras
