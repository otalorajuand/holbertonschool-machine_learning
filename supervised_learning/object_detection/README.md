# Object Detection

> Image classification is just the start of image processing. Object detection consists in classifying the objects in an image and locate them inside the image. In this project, we explore the most famous object detection model, Yolo, and build its part in order to use it.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is OpenCV and how do you use it?
* What is object detection?
* What is the Sliding Windows algorithm?
* What is a single-shot detector?
* What is the YOLO algorithm?
* What is IOU and how do you calculate it?
* What is non-max suppression?
* What are anchor boxes?
* What is mAP and how do you calculate it?
