# Keras

> Keras is the most popular high level deep learning frameworks. It acts as an API of Tensorflow and has easily way to implement. We explore its functionalities and its scope in this project. 

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is Keras?
* What is a model?
* How to instantiate a model (2 ways)
* How to build a layer
* How to add regularization to a layer
* How to add dropout to a layer
* How to add batch normalization
* How to compile a model
* How to optimize a model
* How to fit a model
* How to use validation data
* How to perform early stopping
* How to measure accuracy
* How to evaluate a model
* How to make a prediction with a model
* How to access the weights/outputs of a model
* What is HDF5?
* How to save and load a model’s weights, a model’s configuration, and the entire model
