# Transformer Applications

> In this project, I explore the use of Transformers, a powerful deep learning architecture, for various natural language processing tasks, like machine translation. By the end of this project, you will gain insights into how to leverage Transformers for machine translation, implement custom train/test loops in Keras, and harness the capabilities of TensorFlow Datasets.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* How to use Transformers for Machine Translation
* How to write a custom train/test loop in Keras
* How to use Tensorflow Datasets

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

| Filename | Task |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | 
| [0-dataset.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/supervised_learning/transformer_apps/0-dataset.py)| Create the class Dataset that loads and preps a dataset for machine translation. | 
| [1-dataset.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/supervised_learning/transformer_apps/1-dataset.py)| Update the class Dataset. Create the instance method that encodes a translation into tokens. | 
| [2-dataset.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/supervised_learning/transformer_apps/2-dataset.py)| Update the class Dataset. Create the instance method that acts as a tensorflow wrapper for the encode. | 
| [3-dataset.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/supervised_learning/transformer_apps/3-dataset.py)| Update the class Dataset to set up the data pipeline. |
