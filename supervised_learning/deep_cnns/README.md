# Deep CNNs

> There are always new models that are published in papers that improve, in this case, the image recognition task. An important skill is to replicate this models in the current frameworks. In this project we implement the main CNNs that have generated some kind of improvement in the task of image recognition. 

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is a skip connection?
* What is a bottleneck layer?
* What is the Inception Network?
* What is ResNet? ResNeXt? DenseNet?
* How to replicate a network architecture by reading a journal article
