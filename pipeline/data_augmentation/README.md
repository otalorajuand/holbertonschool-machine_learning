# Data Augmentation

> The "Data Augmentation" project delves deep into the pivotal role of enhancing datasets through various augmentation techniques in machine learning. This project is designed to address fundamental questions about data augmentation, including its definition, optimal application scenarios, benefits for improving model performance, diverse augmentation methodologies, and the integration of machine learning for automating this process. Through hands-on tasks focused on image augmentation operations, participants gain practical insights into implementing augmentation methods programmatically. This project aims to equip learners with a comprehensive understanding of data augmentation's significance in machine learning and its practical implementation for refining datasets.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is data augmentation?
* When should you perform data augmentation?
* What are the benefits of using data augmentation?
* What are the various ways to perform data augmentation?
* How can you use ML to automate data augmentation?
