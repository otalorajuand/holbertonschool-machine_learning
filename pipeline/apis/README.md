# Data Collection - APIs

> The "APIs Exploration" project focuses on understanding and utilizing various APIs for data retrieval and interaction. It includes comprehensive learning materials, specific task requirements, and hands-on exercises. Tasks involve working with different APIs, making HTTP requests, managing rate limits, handling pagination, fetching and manipulating JSON data. The project's goal is to gain practical experience in using APIs, emphasizing proficiency in data retrieval and manipulation with Python.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* How to use the Python package requests
* How to make HTTP GET request
* How to handle rate limit
* How to handle pagination
* How to fetch JSON resources
* How to manipulate data from an external service

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

| Filename | Task |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | 
| [0-passengers.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/pipeline/apis/0-passengers.py)| Returns the list of ships that can hold a given number of passengers. |
| [1-sentience.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/pipeline/apis/1-sentience.py)| Returns the list of names of the home planets of all sentient species. |
| [2-user_location.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/pipeline/apis/2-user_location.py)| Retrieves github info. |
