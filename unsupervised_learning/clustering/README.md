# Clustering

> Clustering is a unsupervised method for grouping the data points between those who have similiar features. In this project we explore two of the most common algorithms: k-means and GMM.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is a multimodal distribution?
* What is a cluster?
* What is cluster analysis?
* What is “soft” vs “hard” clustering?
* What is K-means clustering?
* What are mixture models?
* What is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)?
* What is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm?
* How to implement the EM algorithm for GMMs
* What is cluster variance?
* What is the mountain/elbow method?
* What is the Bayesian Information Criterion?
* How to determine the correct number of clusters
* What is Hierarchical clustering?
* What is Agglomerative clustering?
* What is Ward’s method?
* What is Cophenetic distance?
* What is scikit-learn?
* What is scipy?
