# Hidden Markov Models

> Hidden markov models allow us to model unobservable sequential data are somehow related to observable data. With this model we can estimate the most probable sequence of the unobserved data.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is the Markov property?
* What is a Markov chain?
* What is a state?
* What is a transition probability/matrix?
* What is a stationary state?
* What is a regular Markov chain?
* How to determine if a transition matrix is regular
* What is an absorbing state?
* What is a transient state?
* What is a recurrent state?
* What is an absorbing Markov chain?
* What is a Hidden Markov Model?
* What is a hidden state?
* What is an observation?
* What is an emission probability/matrix?
* What is a Trellis diagram?
* What is the Forward algorithm and how do you implement it?
* What is decoding?
* What is the Viterbi algorithm and how do you implement it?
* What is the Forward-Backward algorithm and how do you implement it?
* What is the Baum-Welch algorithm and how do you implement it?
