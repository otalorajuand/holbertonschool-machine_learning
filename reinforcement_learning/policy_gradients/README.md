# Policy Gradients

> The "Policy Gradients" project involves implementing and understanding Policy Gradient algorithms in reinforcement learning, specifically focusing on the Monte-Carlo policy gradient algorithm (REINFORCE). The project comprises reading materials, learning objectives, and task-specific requirements like coding standards and module documentation. The tasks include creating a policy function, computing Monte-Carlo policy gradients, and implementing training with a defined environment. It culminates in visualizing the training progress using matplotlib and customizing the training to display the environment periodically for analysis. The project emphasizes reinforcement learning concepts and Python proficiency while implementing Policy Gradient methods for training agents.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is Policy?
* How to calculate a Policy Gradient?
* What and how to use a Monte-Carlo policy gradient?

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

| Filename | Task |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | 
| [policy_gradient.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/reinforcement_learning/policy_gradients/policy_gradient.py)| Defines a function for training using policy gradients. It loops through episodes, updates weights based on rewards and gradients, and returns all episode scores. | 
| [train.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/reinforcement_learning/policy_gradients/train.py)| Trains the model. | 

### Try It On Your Machine :computer:
```bash
