# Deep Q-learning

> The "Deep Q-learning" project trains an AI agent for Atari's Breakout using deep reinforcement learning. It covers concepts like policy networks, replay memory, and target networks. Two Python scripts, 'train.py' and 'play.py,' are required to train the agent and visualize its gameplay. It focuses on using keras-rl, enforcing coding standards, and specified dependencies.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is Deep Q-learning?
* What is the policy network?
* What is replay memory?
* What is the target network?
* Why must we utilize two separate networks during training?
* What is keras-rl? How do you use it?
