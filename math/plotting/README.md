# Plotting

> In this section we explore plotting with matplotlib, its different arrangements and its applications.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is a plot?
* What is a scatter plot? line graph? bar graph? histogram?
* What is matplotlib?
* How to plot data with matplotlib
* How to label a plot
* How to scale an axis
* How to plot multiple sets of data at the same time
