# Advanced Linear Algebra

> In this project we explore some advanced concepts in linear algebra like how to get the inverse of a matrix, it's eigen values and eigen vectors and more.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is a determinant? How would you calculate it?
* What is a minor, cofactor, adjugate? How would calculate them?
* What is an inverse? How would you calculate it?
* What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors? How would you calculate them?
* What is definiteness of a matrix? How would you determine a matrixâ€™s definiteness?
