# Convolutions and Pooling

> Convolution layer are the fundamental structure of a convolutional neural network (cnn). With this layer we filter images to extract its most important features. Pooling is a technique, that has proved to have great results in practice, that reduce the complexity of images through the neural network to reduce complexity. In this project we explore both concepts and their applications.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is a convolution?
* What is max pooling? average pooling?
* What is a kernel/filter?
* What is padding?
* What is “same” padding? “valid” padding?
* What is a stride?
* What are channels?
* How to perform a convolution over an image
* How to perform max/average pooling over an image
