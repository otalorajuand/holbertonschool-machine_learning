# Probability

> In this project we explore the fundamentals concepts of probability like the main distributions and their usage in order to understand the foundational math of machine learning models.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is probability?
* Basic probability notation
* What is independence? What is disjoint?
* What is a union? intersection?
* What are the general addition and multiplication rules?
* What is a probability distribution?
* What is a probability distribution function? probability mass function?
* What is a cumulative distribution function?
* What is a percentile?
* What is mean, standard deviation, and variance?
* Common probability distributions
