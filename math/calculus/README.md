# Calculus

> In this project we explore the fundamentals concepts of calculus like derivatives, integrals, sums, etc... to have a foundations for the maths of machine learning algorithms.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* Summation and Product notation
* What is a series?
* Common series
* What is a derivative?
* What is the product rule?
* What is the chain rule?
* Common derivative rules
* What is a partial derivative?
* What is an indefinite integral?
* What is a definite integral?
* What is a double integral?
