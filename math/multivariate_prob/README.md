# Multivariate Probability

> In this project there are tasks dealing with multivariate probability and some concepts like normal multivariate function, mean, covariance and correlation based on a matrix of data.

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* Who is Carl Friedrich Gauss?
* What is a joint/multivariate distribution?
* What is a covariance?
* What is a correlation coefficient?
* What is a covariance matrix?
* What is a multivariate Gaussian distribution?

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

| Filename | Task |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | 
| [0-mean_cov.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/math/multivariate_prob/0-mean_cov.py)| Calculates the mean and covariance of a data set. |
| [1-correlation.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/math/multivariate_prob/1-correlation.py)| Calculates a correlation matrix. |
| [multinormal.py](https://github.com/otalorajuand/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/math/multivariate_prob/multinormal.py)| Class that represents a Multivariate Normal distribution. |
