> This is a repository of machine learning, where I developed projects related to supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, fundamental maths, etc. I used mostly the programming language Python and libraries like Keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch. I understand the most important models of machine learning by constructing them and using them in interesting areas.
